MinilibX

Simplified graphic programming interface for beginners
#

This minilibX is the native version for MacOSX.
[It no longer uses X11 graphics libraries, nor XQuartz the X server for MacOSX. ]
The interface / API, remains identical to the previous version. The man presents in the minilibX
of origin are still valid.

The mlx.h file to include in your programs reminds small differences in behavior
between the 2 versions, due to the different graphic management according to the operating systems.

#

This version uses MacOSX's Cocoa window system (AppKit), and primitives
modern OpenGL graphics.
